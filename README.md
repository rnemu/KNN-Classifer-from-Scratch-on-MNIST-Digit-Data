# MNIST Digit Classification Using KNN-Classifier From Scratch
## Overview
In this project, my aim is to classify digits ranging from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset.I have implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifer algorithm from scratch . KNN is a simple classification algorithm that is based on the distance between data points.

## Dataset
I have utilized the popular MNIST dataset, which is a widely used  dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels,located in **Data** directory.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Directory containing the MNIST dataset.
- **knn_mnist_data.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for implementing **KNN algorithm for digit classification from scratch**.
